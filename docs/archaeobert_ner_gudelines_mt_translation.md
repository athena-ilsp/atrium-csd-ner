This document provides guidelines for annotating archaeological reports based on Brandsen, A. (2024). The goal of the annotation is to identify and tag "archeological concepts" (also called entities) within the text. These concepts include:

- ARTEFACT -> Artefacts: Objects found in the ground, ranging from small items like pollen to large ones like canoes. Includes building-related objects (e.g. "beams", "planks", "beams") and general concepts like "waste" and "pottery". However, do not annotate overly general categories such as "artefact",  "find material", "finds" "find complexes, or "archeobotanical material". When a descriptive adjective is present, include it (e.g., "burnt wattle and daub", "carbonized wood", "rough-walled sherd") unless the adjective refers to a material (e.g., "metal household goods"). Natural finds like "iron ore" and "index fossils" are also included. Examples: "Iron Age shards", "Rim of a smooth-walled jug", "Pottery concentrations".

- PERIOD -> Time Periods: This category encompasses dates and periods. When a date includes a day/month, only annotate the year (e.g., "2012" from "12 december 2012" (December 12, 2012)). For time spans with multiple years, include surrounding words (e.g., "between approx. 1700 and 1850" & "from 300 to 100 BC"). Annotate complete time periods (e.g., "Late Medieval" "early 14th century" "last quarter of the 15th century"). If words like "after", "before", "in the course of", "circa", "approximately" precede a time period, do not include them in the annotation (e.g., only "12th century" from "before the 12th century"). Do not annotate "around", only the year/period following it (e.g., "around 1100" becomes "1100"). If a time period is followed by a year in parentheses, annotate them separately (e.g., "Middle Ages (500-1500 AD)"). Include years in references (e.g., "(Smit, 2004)" in the running text and in the bibliography references). Do not annotate years in codes (e.g., "Rapport 2009-61 ARC"). Do not annotate the article, so in "The Late Middle Ages", do not annotate "the" (but in "First half of the 19th century", annotate everything including "of the"). Include "time" and "period" for terms such as "Carolingian period", "Medieval period". Also annotate words denoting a period, such as "the Carolingian Empire" and "Roman law". For dendrochronological dating, annotate the years plus uncertainty, not the season (e.g., "spring/summer 1478 and 1483 +6"). Also consider more general time periods such as "historical time", "recent", "(pre-)historic". Do not include the word 'period' (e.g., "Period Late Neolithic" becomes "Late Neolithic"). Also include years in references (e.g., "Van As 2010", "Smit 2000b"). Do not include relative periods such as "Later periods". Also include things like "600 years ago"). Annotate ABR period codes as separate annotations: "Neolithic (NEO)".

- LOCATION -> Locations and places: This includes municipalities, provinces, and countries. For municipalities, annotate only the place name (e.g., "Municipality Zutphen" becomes Zutphen). Annotate full addresses, for example "P.O. Box 12, 1234NN, Leiden" and "Steenstraat 34, Groningen". Do not annotate "Dutch archaeologists" or "Amsterdam organization". Do not include directions in your annotations (e.g., "Northern France", "Southern Netherlands"). Unless the direction is part of the place name: "North Holland". Do not annotate general place designations such as "the Dutch coastal area". But do annotate things like "University of Amsterdam". Do not annotate adjectives indicating a place, such as "Zutphen castle", "Dutch part", "German monastery". Do not annotate (highways), rivers, seas, lakes, canals, etc.. Do not annotate coordinates. If the word 'at/in' is used, include it in one annotation (e.g., "Valtherweg in Exloo"). Do not annotate abbreviations for provinces, such as "NH" (North Holland). If 'at/in' is present, also annotate the part before it (e.g., "Kastanjestraat in Hoorn", "Ankeveen polder in Ankeveen").

- CONTEXT -> Contexts: Human-made features that are not artefacts and can generally contain artefacts. This includes features like "cesspit", "moat", "granary", "ditch", "ring fort", "burial mound", etc.. Also annotate features even if no finds were present (e.g., "rampart" or "wall remains"). Do not annotate natural contexts, for example "peat layer", "cover sand", "beach ridge", "dune" or "polder vague soils". Do not annotate ground types, for example "sand", "clay", "peat", "clay layer", "clayey sand". Do not annotate modern contexts, such as "found in the office basement", where "basement" is a modern context. Do not annotate overly general contexts such as "buildings", "monument", "trace cluster". Do not annotate general designations for traces such as "disturbances", "traces", "settlement traces", "settlement area". Adjectives can be skipped: "Shallow postholes" becomes "postholes", "Iron Age traces" becomes "traces".

- MATERIAL -> Materials: These are what an artefact is made of. Only annotate materials when they refer to the material of an artefact. So, only "flint axe" & "arrowhead made of bone", not "the glass from this excavation" (that is an artefact). The same applies to, for example, "The large amount of pottery and glass" and "worked pieces of flint"; annotate these as artefacts as well. Architectural terms for materials can be annotated (e.g., "the brick wall" or "constructed in brick"). Annotate modern materials: "Concrete garage". Do not annotate adjectives modifying materials (e.g., "molten bronze" becomes "bronze", "Oak wood" becomes "wood").

- SPECIES -> (Animal and Plant) Species: Remember to include humans as a species; "human bones" (annotate "bones" as artefact). But, for example, do not annotate "the human" & "human influence". For cases like "cattle skull", annotate the whole word as an artefact. If a Latin species name is followed by a English one, annotate them separately: "dwarf birch".

**General Rules:**

* Do not annotate articles (unless they are in the middle of an annotation). So, for example, "de bijl" (the axe) and "de 2e eeuw" (the 2nd century) (annotate only "bijl" and "2e eeuw") but "Eerste helft van de 19e eeuw" (First half of the 19th century).
* If something is in parentheses before or after an entity, include it if it belongs to the entity ; for example "(laat) middeleeuws" ((late) medieval) & "wal(len)" (rampart(s)).
* If "of" (or) is used to indicate multiple possibilities, annotate the possibilities separately: "eind van de 11e of begin van de 12e" (end of the 11th or beginning of the 12th).
* Do not annotate quantity words, such as "enkele graven" (some graves), "een paar schrabbers" (a few scrapers).
